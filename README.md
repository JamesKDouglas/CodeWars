# CodeWars

This is just a repository to share some solutions to CodeWars.

At the 100Devs agency we have a guideline for using the CodeWars website: If you've been working on something for over 20 minutes, look at the solution. 

So try the exercises on you own first, then if you are having difficulty please take a look. These are my solutions, and are often more verbose than the solutions focused on regex or "code golf" solutions.
